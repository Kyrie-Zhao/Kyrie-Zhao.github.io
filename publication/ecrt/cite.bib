abstract = {Real-time image-based object tracking from live video is of great importance for several
smart city applications like surveillance, intelligent traffic management and autonomous
driving. Although recent deep learning systems can achieve satisfactory tracking performance,
they incur significant compute overhead, which prevents them from wide adoption on
resource-constrained IoT platforms. In this demonstration, we present an Edge Computing
system for Real-time object Tracking (ECRT) for resource-constrained devices. The
key feature of our system is that it intelligently partitions compute-intensive tasks
such as inferencing a convolutional neural network(CNN) into two parts, which are
executed locally on an IoT device and/or on the edge server. Moreover, ECRT can minimize
the power consumption of IoT devices while taking into consideration the dynamic network
environment and user requirement on end to end delay.},
