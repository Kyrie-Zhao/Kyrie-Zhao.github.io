abstract = {In recent years, deep learning algorithms are increasingly adopted by a wide range
of data-intensive and time-critical Internet of Things (IoT) applications. As a result,
several new approaches, including model partition/offloading and progressive neural
architecture, have been proposed to address the challenge of deploying the computation-intensive
deep neural network (DNN) models on resource-constrained edge devices. However, the
performance of existing approaches is highly affected by runtime dynamics. For example,
offloading workload from edge to cloud suffers from communication delays and the efficiency
of progressive neural architecture supporting early-exit DNN executions relies on
input characteristics. In this paper, we introduce EdgeML, an AutoML framework that
provides flexible and fine-grained DNN model execution control by combining workload
offloading mechanism and dynamic progressive neural architecture. To achieve desirable
latency-accuracy-energy system performance on edge platforms, EdgeML adopts reinforcement
learning to automatically update model execution policy in response to runtime dynamics
in real-time. We implement EdgeML for several widely used DNN models on the latest
edge devices. Comparing to existing approaches, our experiments show that EdgeML achieves
up to 8\texttimes{} performance improvement under dynamic environments.},
